晚安,甜心

我得好好疼你
Mama gonna kiss you.

171
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,890
"晚安歌"
Good night song

172
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,390
爸爸演唱 什么?
-With your dad... -What?

173
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,210
怎么?唱歌时间啊
What? It's time for your good-night song.

174
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,920
哦,今天不用了
Oh, no, thanks.

175
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,300
我现在听白噪音
I'm listening to white noise!

176
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,890
能助睡!
Helps me fall asleep!

177
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,270
嘿 要不
Hey, what would you say

178
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,230
让我帮你排练节目?
to me helping you rehearse for the holiday pageant?

179
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,690
好主意 是吧
Yes! Right?

180
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,560
我可以和你一起去学校,
I can come to school with you, and you can get

181
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,230
和你的朋友们一起排练节目
all your friends together, and we can rehearse together,

182
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,230
之后去吃冰淇淋
go get some ice cream after.

183
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,320
我请客 不!不行
-My treat. -No! You can't do that.

184
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
我想靠自己完成
Um, liability issues.

185
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,240
整个节目
It's this whole thing.

186
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,580
哦 好吧
Oh. Right, right.

187
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,830
好…
Right.

188
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,450
你最爱的睡前故事要听吗
Whoa. How about your favorite bedtime story?

189
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,370
你知道的,关于…
You know, the one about...

190
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,460
泰德叔叔是个会说话的神奇宝宝
Uncle Ted was a magical talking baby.

191
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
有一个装满小狗的火箭
There was a rocket full of puppies,

192
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,500
你拯救了世界
and you saved the world.

193
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,920
精彩的故事,对吧?
It was a good story, wasn't it?

194
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,970
额,就是有点扯
Well, it didn't really make a lot of sense.

195
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,760
不过还是很有趣吧
The jokes were good, right?

196
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,220
嗯哼
Mm.

197
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,260
好吧 爸爸
-Okay. Um... -Dad.

198
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,930
我想早点睡 明天有很多事
My schedule is brutal tomorrow.

199
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,940
我也是 明天要早起
Yeah. My schedule's pretty brutal, too.

200
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,940
别忘了"咩咩"
Oh, don't forget Lamb Lamb.

201
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,770
晚安,"咩咩"
Good night, Lamb Lamb.

202
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,690
晚安,泰德叔叔
Good night, Uncle Ted.

203
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,530
我希望长大后能像你一样成功
I hope to grow up and be a success, just like you.

204
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,820
也许我们很快就能见面
Maybe we'll see you soon.

205
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,830
晚安,塔比莎
Good night, Tabitha.

206
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,830
你不觉得那很幼稚吗
Don't you think I'm a little old for that now?

207
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,500
呃,好吧
Uh, okay.

208
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,050
给彼此一点空间
I think it's time we both grow up.

209
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,920
我会早起做早餐 你多睡会吧
I look forward to greeting you at the breakfast table.

210
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,730
祝你做美梦
Sweet dreams.

211
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,620
嗯
Hmm.

212
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,340
昔日的时光都去哪了?
Where has the time gone?

213
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,800
我怎么会知道?
How should I know?

214
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,590
等下 我看到光了
Wait, wait. I see light.

215
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,550
快滚开
You, oh, out of my way.

216
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,680
终于
At long last.

217
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,390
自由的空气
The sweet breath of freedom.

218
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,640
威兹?
Wizzie?

219
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,350
嘿 这是哪个世纪?
You there, what century is this?

220
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,690
放开我,邪恶的食人魔!
Unhand me, vile ogre!

221
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,280
威兹 是我啊
No, no, no, no. Wizzie, it's me.

222
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,820
我是蒂姆
It's Tim.

223
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,780
真的吗?
Is it really you?

224
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,450
靠过来一点
Come closer.

225
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,410
让我看看你的脸
Let me see your face.

226
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,200
在近点
Closer.

227
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,290
更近一点
Closer still.

228
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,120
哦,蒂莫西
Oh, Timothy.

229
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,370
是你啊
It is you.

230
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,080
嘿! 为啥打我?
Hey! What was that for?

231
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,290
你把我丢进了永恒的黑暗
You cast me into eternal darkness

232
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,210
破坏了我的计时功能
and wreaked havoc on my circadian rhythms.

233
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,550
对不起,威兹
I'm sorry, Wizzie.

234
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,220
嘿 你保存的很好
Hey, but you look great, though.

235
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,430
断臂让我美中不足
Except for the arm, you mean.

236
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,720
我都没注意到
I didn't even notice.

237
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,140
-你看不见? -我是说,我注意到了
-You thought it. -I mean, I noticed it,

238
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,760
这很明显 我只是不想
'cause I... you obviously don't have an arm. I-I...

239
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,680
你绝不会这样对"咩咩"的
You would never treat Lamb Lamb this way.

240
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,480
我把它给了我女儿,塔比莎
Well, I... I gave her to my daughter, Tabitha.

241
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,270
你有继承人了吗,蒂莫西?
You have produced an heir, Timothy?

242
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,610
两个孩子呢
Two, actually.

243
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,570
两个? 敲钟庆祝吧!
Two? Let the bells ring!

244
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,190
不,不 威兹,停下来 太好了!
-No, no, no. Wizzie, stop. -Yes! Yes!

245
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,070
威兹,嘘!安静 这是欢庆的时刻!
-Wizzie, shh! Quiet, quiet. -It's a time for celebration!

246
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,070
别 现在大家都在睡觉
No, no, no. It's not the time for celebration.

247
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,780
威兹,嘘 保持安静 什么?它是什么?
-Wizzie, shh. Be quiet. -What? What is it?

248
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,700
怎么了,蒂姆? 我不知道
-What is it, Tim? -I don't know.

249
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,540
我今天有点失落
I guess I'm just not feeling

250
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,660
不想庆祝
very celebratory right now.

251
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,580
哦?
Oh?

252
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,420
塔比莎
Tabitha.

253
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,590
老兄,她长得真快
Man, Wizzie, she's growing up so fast.

254
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,630
好像已经不需要我了
It's like she doesn't even need me anymore.

255
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,220
对,首先,他们冷落你
Yes, first, they start spending less time with you.

256
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,890
接着 不再向你寻求建议
Then they stop coming to you for advice.

257
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,890
正是
Exactly.

258
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,020
然后 认为你无关紧要
Soon, they take you for granted.

259
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,430
可能吧
I guess.

260
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,390
之后打断你的胳膊 什么?
-Then break your arm. -What?

261
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,980
最后把你抛之脑后!
Then stuff you into a box!

262
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,940
威兹,你在帮倒忙
Okay. Wizzie, you're... you're not helping.

263
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,610
我只是…害怕
Okay, I'm just... I'm afraid

264
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,690
塔比莎和我会渐行渐远
Tabitha and I are growing apart,

265
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,780
…就像我和泰德一样
like... like I did with my brother.

266
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,490
哦
Oh.

267
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,580
我还在感今惟昔
I thought we had all the time in the world.

268
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,290
但你不能回到过去,对吧?
But you can't turn back time, can you?

269
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,920
你竟敢质疑我的力量!
How dare you question my power!

270
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,340
"时光倒流" 又来了
-Turn back. Turn back. -Oh, here we go.

271
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,960
伟大的时间之轮… 等
-Oh, great wheel of li... -Wait.

272
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,800
你听到了吗?
Did you hear that?

273
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,800
别乱用"贪睡"按钮!
Never abuse the snooze button!

274
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,890
声音像是从宝宝房传来的
It sounds like it's coming from the baby's room.

275
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,890
是个夜行性生物?
What is it? A creature of the night?

276
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,980
女巫吗?还是地狱之犬的叫声?
Witches? Is it the baying of the hounds of hell?

277
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,310
威兹!
Wizzie!

278
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,480
别去,蒂姆!
Don't go, Tim!

279
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,060
我可以让时光倒流
I can turn back time--

280
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,650
到只有你和我的黄金岁月
to the golden years, when it was just you and me.

281
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,320
我的胳膊
My good arm.

282
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,070
别开门
Don't open the door.

283
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,990
还记得上次吗!
Remember last time!

284

这领带是假的
It's a clip-on tie.

304
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,000
你要知道宝宝公司…
You see, Daddy, BabyCorp is more of what I...

305
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,670
哦
Oops.

爸爸 你能听到我说话吗?
Daddy, Daddy, come in. Can you hear me?

307
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,670
听得到吗?
Daddy, do you read me?

308
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,380
爸爸,这是几?
Daddy, how many fingers am I holding up?

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,590
星期四吗?
Thursday?

310
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,890
我应该先提醒你的
I should've given you a warning.

311
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,430
我还以为你很酷
I forgot you were an old man.

312
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,930
等等
Wait, wait.

313
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,810
你是宝贝公司的? 嗯
-You're from BabyCorp? -Yes.

314
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,810
宝宝公司更像是
BabyCorp is more of what I call

315

我的主业是邓普顿家族

邓普顿加油! 哦!好吧

-I have to say, you got a lot of issues. -Sure. Yeah.

322
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,450
这个稍后在详聊
We'll talk about that later.

323
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,870
哦,天啊 我真不敢相信
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe this.

324
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,040
想去吓一下妈妈吗?
Hey, want to go scare the crap out of Mom?

325
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,000
爹地,请集中精神
Daddy, please stay focused. Oh.

326
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,540
对,对,对
Right, right, right.

327
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,250
宝宝公司出现了危机
There's a crisis at BabyCorp.

328
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,380
这次又怎么了?
What is it this time?

329
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,420
小猫?
Kittens?

330
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,550
不 这一次,情况更糟
No. This time, it's even worse.

331
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,800
比上次还糟?嗯
-Worse than kittens? -Yes.

332
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,590
所以我才自愿加入
That's why I volunteered for

333
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,470
这绝密的任务 妈妈
-this supersecret assignment. -Mommy.

334
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,390
哦,我想帮忙 我该怎么做?
Ooh, I want to help. What-what do you want me to do?

335
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,930
就是要这种干劲
That's the spirit, Daddy.

336
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,770
你正是我需要的人 好的!
-You are exactly who I need. -Yes!

337
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,560
去找泰德叔叔
To get Uncle Ted.

338
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,270
不 什么?
No. What?

339
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,770
你这是什么表情?
What-What's with the face?

340
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,270
爸爸,宝宝公司不能再等了
Daddy, BabyCorp can't wait any longer.

341
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,570
所有的压力都在我身上,爸
All the pressure's on me, Pop.

342
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,780
当我自愿参加这项工作时
When I volunteered for this gig,

343
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,700
我以为会很容易
I thought it would be easy.

344
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,280
但你们俩从不联系
But you two never see each other.

345
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,860
真可悲
It's so sad.

346
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,080
就像 "不及格 留堂"
It's like, "F-minus. See me after class."

347
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,620
可悲? 或许吧
Sad? Uh, yeah, maybe.

348
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,830
有点 我不确定
A little. I don't know.

349
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,250
我不是让你打电话给他吗?
Did you forget to call him?

350
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,170
我发现你有点心不在焉
I noticed you can be a little absentminded.

351
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,540
你说什么?
Sorry, what?

352
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,290
我说你有拖延症
It's just that you tend to procrastinate.

353
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,460
你得让他来家里过节
You have to get him here for the holidays.

354
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,760
不,我还没…
No, I'm not...

355
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,170
不,我等会再打
No, I'm not gonna call him right now.

356
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,630
-拖延症老爸 -别
-Daddy, can't never could. -No.

357
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,010
你俩吵架了? 发生了什么?
Did you two have a fight or something?

358
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,800
没 你对他有怨气?
-No. -But you're mad at him?

359
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,100
别打了 说来话长
Stop that. It's complicated.

360
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,220
打个电话不就搞清楚了?
Why? Do you need help using your phone?

361
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,980
我自己会解决
No, I don't need help using my...

362
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,520
好 问题在哪?
Okay. What's the problem?

363
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,020
告诉我
What's the issue? Talk to me.

364
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,770
打了也没用
There's no point, okay?

365
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,820
我打电话邀请他 他从不来
I call him. I invite him. He never shows up.

366
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,820
他总是要参加工作会议或出差
He's always got a work meeting or a business trip

367
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,490
或者是电话会议
or a conference call.

368
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,360
他只关心工作
All he cares about is work.

369
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,330
时间长了就不想联系了
But after a while, you... you just stop trying.

370
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,540
他还是你兄弟
He's still your brother.

371
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,830
你俩是合作伙伴
You were partners.

372
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,580
对,可是长大后…
Yeah, I guess sometimes you just...

373
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,710
我成家 他立业
you grow up and grow apart.

374
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,470
别放弃 爹地
Daddy, don't say no.

375
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,880
如果大家都轻言放弃
What if everybody said no?

376
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,050
奇迹就不会发生
Nothing would happen.

377
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,470
九层之台 起于累土
Nothing would get off the ground.

378
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,800
太阳每天照常升起
You got to wake up every day

379
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,600
你得乐观一点
and you got to say, "Yes, yes, yes!"

380
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,020
让我刮目相看吧
Surprise me. Say yes.

381
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,690
这真令人失望
This is really disappointing.

382
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,980
现在我很生气! 不早了
-And now I'm getting mad! -It's late.

383
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,070
我们明天再商量,好吗?
We can work on this tomorrow, okay?

384
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,700
哦 你的玩具掉下来了
Oh. Whoopsie. Your little horsey fell off.

385
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,240
不急这一晚,对吧?
Another day won't hurt, right?

386
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,750
晚安,亲爱的
Good night, sweetie.

387
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,540
晚安,亲爱的
Good night, sweetie.

388
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,380
…"独角兽"掉了
...horsey fell off.

389
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,050
塔比莎?
Tabitha?

390
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,400
嗯?
Huh?

391
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,300
不用管 我来开门
Uh, don't worry. I got it.

392
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,180
她在哪里呢?哪里?
Where is she? Where is she?

393
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,930
你说谁? 我已经尽快赶来了
-Where's who? What? -I came as fast as I could.

394
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,480
泰德? 我推掉了会议行程
-Ted? -I canceled all my meetings.

395
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,440
你来干什么? 讲什么?
What are you doing here? Why are you yelling?

396
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,690
塔比莎呢? 塔比莎?
-Where's Tabitha? -Tabitha?

397
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,110
蒂姆呢? 泰德叔叔
-Where is she, Tim? -Ted.

398
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,770
泰德叔叔,你真的来了!
Uncle Ted, you're here! You're really here.

399
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,360
是哪只手臂? 嗯?
-Which arm is it? Left or right? -Huh?

400
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,280
是小腿吗?和我讲 啊
-Is it your fibula? Talk to me. -Whoa.

401
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,280
腓骨
fibula
下肢小腿长骨之一

402
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,950
瞳孔正常 睁眼
Good dilation. Open up.

403
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,860
张嘴 你没事吧? 你在干什么?
-Say, "Ah." Are you okay? -Wh-What are you doing?

404
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,160
-你没受伤啊 -嗯?
-You look okay. -Whoa.

405
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,950
别担心 我很好 叔叔
Don't worry. I'm fine, Uncle Ted.

406
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,290
命真硬 哦吼
-That's my girl. -Woo-hoo.

407
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,910
什么风把你吹来了?
Uh, wh-what brings you into town?

408
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,290
塔比莎从马上摔下来了
Well, Tabitha fell off her pony.

409
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,120
有吗? 是吗?
-She did? -She did?

410
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,130
我没吧?
I did?

411
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,290
蒂姆给我留了语音留言 他?
-Tim left me a voice mail. -He did?

412
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,840
我? 是啊
-I did? -You did.

413
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,760
嘿 兄弟是我
Hello. This is your brother.

414
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,470
快来帮我 塔比莎从马上摔了下来
Help. Tabitha fell off horsey.

415
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,720
晚安,亲爱的
Good night, sweetie.

416
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,390
这真让人费解
Well, that was unsettling.

417
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,970
我发誓没留言
I swear I didn't leave that message.

418
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:09,060
…无意的
On... purpose.

419
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,190
我…
I...

420
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,190
不小心按错?
Butt-dialed?

421
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,690
用我的屁股
With my butt.

422
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,060
在我说梦话的时候
While I was talking in my sleep.

423
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,650
之前发生过
I do that sometimes.

424
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,280
这都能给我留言?
You sleep-butt-dialed me?

425
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,360
用我的屁股
With my butt.

426
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,780
这肯定得有个合理的解释
I knew there must be a perfectly logical explanation.

427
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,580
是乌龙事件
And there it is.

428
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,490
嗯 你终于来家做客啦
-Hmm. -All that matters is that you're here.

429
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,080
啊!耶!
Woo-hoo! Yay!

430
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,160
是啊 额,暂时是
Absolutely. Uh, for now.

431
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,170
泰德叔叔,请留下来过圣诞节
Uncle Ted, please stay for Christmas. Please.

432
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,840
对不起,小宝贝 25号我有安排
Sorry, sweetie. I can't do Christmas on the 25th.

433
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,090
但是,泰德叔叔,我很想你
But, Uncle Ted, I missed you so much.

434
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,840
好久没见你了
I missed you so much.

435
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,950
我好想你…
I missed you so much.

436
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,780
你不觉得那很幼稚吗
Don't you think I'm a little old for that now?

437
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,270
我不在是小孩了
Don't you think I'm a little old for that now?

438
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,120
(请给我独立自主的空间)
Don't you think I'm a little old for that now?

439
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,890
我能和你去厨房谈谈吗?
Can I talk to you in the kitchen?

440
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,270
就我们俩
Alone.

441
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,270
"宝贝",蒂姆?
The baby, Tim?

442
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,940
她是被那里派来的
She's been sent from up there.

443
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,610
-楼上吗? -对 "宝贝公司"
-Upstairs? -That's right. BabyCorp.

444
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,160
语音求助是"宝宝公司"留的?
So you're saying the voice mail was some kind of call for help.

445
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,160
是的!不
Yes! No.

446
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,080
她来自一个由宝宝经营的秘密公司
She comes from a secret corporation run by babies.

447
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,040
蒂姆,我给你介绍个医生
Tim, I'm gonna give you the name of a doctor.

448
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,880
罗伊费德 让他给你好好看看
Roy Federman. Just tell him I sent you, okay?

449
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,130
他们在讲什么?
What are they saying?

450
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,310
我们应该给他们点私人空间
We should give them some privacy.

451
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,920
-拿着 -哦 谢谢
-Here you go. -Ooh. Thanks.

452
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,260
我没疯!
I'm not crazy!

453
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,010
你只是忘了 告诉他,蒂娜
You just don't remember. Tell him, Tina.

454
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,340
-他… -宝宝不会讲话
-He... I... -She can't talk, Tim.

455
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,050
别插话
Stop interrupting.

456
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,390
宝宝不说话 你有幻听吧
Interrupting what? I don't hear anything.

457
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,560
你的声音可是异常刺耳呢
Except your obnoxious voice. You hear that.

458
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,730
(我可是全厂最好的播音员)

459
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,730
我的嗓音条件可好了
I have a beautiful voice.

460
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,140
等着
Fine.

461
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,020
我会证明这一切都是真的
I can prove that everything I'm saying is real.

462
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,400
是么? 对!
-Oh, yeah? -Yeah!

463
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,400
吸吮(奶嘴)
Suck it, Ted.

464
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,440
你说什么?
I beg your pardon?

465
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,570
你吸一下
You, suck.

466
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,030
不,还是你来吧
No, no, Tim. You suck.

467
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,400
是时候去买圣诞树啦
Time to go buy a Christmas tree.

468
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,110
家里不是有了吗
But we already have a Christmas tree.

469
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,320
不,我们没有 有啊
-No, we don't. No, we don't. -Yes, we do. Yes, we do.

470
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,910
快点吸…
Suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it.

471
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,450
把那东西移开! 打扰一下
-Get that pacie out of my face! -Excuse me.

472
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,580
我也不想这样 但能提个建议吗?
I hate to interrupt, but may I make a suggestion?

473
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,960
为啥你俩不一起吸
Why don't you both suck it?

474
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,920
哈!
Ha!

475
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,710
她能讲话 很会讲
-She can talk. -A lot.

476
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,510
准备好
Buckle up, boys.

477
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,760
出发啦!
Baby on board!

478
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,970
懂了吗 我说的对吧
That's what I'm talking about! Woo-hoo!

479
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,490
是啊!
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

480
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
哇
Wow.

481
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,620
我回来了
I'm home.

482
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,920
看到了吧
Yeah. See?

483
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,380
我没撒谎
It's all real.

484
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,460
哇
Whoa.

485
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,630
那是我吗?
Is that me?

486
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,380
如果你渴望得到赞颂 那么你如愿了
If you're fishing for a compliment, you caught one!

487
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,800
你是这里的传奇人物
You are a legend in this joint.

488
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,300
一座雕像?
A statue?

489
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,850
是我单枪匹马拯救了公司
Well, I did single-handedly save the company.

490
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,390
双塔奇兵
Double-handedly.

491
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,810
我们是合作伙伴
Right? We were partners.

492
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,940
真的吗?
Really?

493
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,650
我没看到你的雕像
I don't see your statue.

494
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,270
我仍然爱你,爸爸
I still love you, Daddy.

495
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,270
雕像头部比例太大了
They got the head size right.

496
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,820
相信我,你得要有野心
Take it from me, you have to be aggressive

497
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,110
如果你想取得成功
if you want to get ahead.

498
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,820
得拼搏 勇攀高峰
Climb that corporate ladder

499
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,490
直到会当凌绝顶 一览众山小 哇
-until you're the last baby standing at the top. -Wow.

500
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,450
我只想保持工作和生活的平衡
Actually, I prioritize a good work-life balance

501
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:18,000
开放乐观的氛围 重视人才
and a positive environment where my ideas are valued.

502
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,540
你说真的?
Oh, you're serious.

503
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,420
你真有趣 叔叔
You're funny, Uncle Ted.

504
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,670
为什么你的档案里没提到这一点
I wonder why they didn't mention that in your file.

505
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,840
我的资料?
My file?

506
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,380
你看过我档案?
You saw my file?

507
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,680
对啊 都写了什么?
-Yep. -What does it say?

508
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,010
讲了很多
It says a lot.

509
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,430
这里是危机处理中心 哇

是我们监控"宝宝危机"的地方
This is where we monitor all threats

511
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,930
为了全世界的宝宝
to babies around the world.

512
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,230
以及夏威夷
And Hawaii.

513
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,020
这太酷了 这太酷了
This is so cool. This is so cool.

514
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,020
我是哥斯拉
I'm Godzilla.

515
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,570
"快逃命吧!"
"Oh, run for your lives! Run for your lives!"

516
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,940
为什么要带他来? 爸爸,快下来
-Why did we bring him? -Daddy, get down from there.

517
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,700
哦 待会没人的时候再玩
-Aw. -We can play on it later when no one is looking.

518
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,410
都有什么危机? 哦
-What's the crisis? -Yeah.

519
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,030
开始吧 都有什么危机,亲爱的?
Here we go. What's the crisis, sweetie?

520

Rusty, roll it.

521
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,370
他新来的
He's new.

522
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,210
想象一下,宝宝外科医生
DR. Just imagine, baby surgeons.

523
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,540
哦
Uh-oh.

524
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,880
或宝宝宇航员
Or baby astronauts.

525
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,050
遨游~(宇宙)
Floaty, floaty, float.

526
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,390
总有一天宝宝会统治世界
Yes, babies are gonna run the world one day.

527
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,640
这一天来得比你想象的要早
And that day is coming sooner than you think.

528
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,640
你好 我是欧文•阿姆斯特朗博士
Hello. My name is Dr. Erwin Armstrong,

529
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,230
橡子高级儿童中学的创始人
founder of The Acorn Center for Advanced Childhood.

530
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,190
等一下,那是…塔比莎的学校
Wait a minute, that's... that's Tabitha's school.

531
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,570
在这里,我们相信宝宝
Here at the center, we believe babies

532
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,190
是终极学习机器
are the ultimate learning machines.

533
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,150
对吧,小内森?
Isn't that right, little Nathan?

534
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,320
-是啊! -不错
-Yeah! -Okay.

535
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,910
他们应该分秒必争
They should use their precious time

536
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,370
突飞猛进 发奋图强
to develop faster, push harder.

537
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,790
-嗯 -父母,他们都是
-Hmm. -Parents, they have the best

538
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,750
望子成龙,但他们不是专家
intentions, of course, but they're not experts.

539
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,880
毕竟,唯一阻碍孩子成长的是…
After all, the only thing holding your child back is...

540
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,670
你 你!
-you. -You!

541
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,380
这就解释了为什么塔比莎一直远离我
This explains why Tabitha's been pulling away from me.

542
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,300
是学校 每个人
-It's the school. -Everybody, wave.

543
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,890
再见,妈妈 再见,妈妈!
-Bye, Mommy. -Bye, Mommy!

544
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,140
再见,爸爸 再见,爸爸!
-Bye, Daddy. -Bye, Daddy!

545
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,760
再会
Sayonara.

546
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,850
在过去的六个月里
Now, in the past six months,

547
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,850
这些学校如雨后春笋般在世界各地出现
these schools have been popping up all over the world.

548
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,100
呃,危机到底是什么?
Uh, so what's the problem?

549
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,770
学校就是问题所在
The school is the problem.

550
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,230
学校都是坏的
Yeah. School is evil.

551
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,440
不,爸爸,不能一概而论
No, Daddy, not all schools are evil.

552
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,570
就只有这个是 好的
-It's just this one, okay? -Okay.

553
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,700
如果博士的谬论继续传播
If Armstrong's philosophy keeps spreading,

554
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,870
这可能终结童年
it could be the end of childhood.

555
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,330
不
No.

556
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,660
童年是我一生中最糟糕的三年
Childhood was the worst three years of my life.

557
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,250
真可悲
That's so sad.

558
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,120
你只是没有好好体会过
You probably just didn't do it right.

559
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,420
-嗯? -嗯
-Huh? -Aw.

560
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,670
幸运的是,你可以重来一次
But luckily, you get a do-over.

561
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,880
第二次机会
A second chance.

562
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,550
我们开发了一种新的超级宝宝奶粉
BabyCorp has developed a new super-duper baby formula

563
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,470
能让大人变回宝宝
that can turn a grown-up back into a baby.

564
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,810
有樱桃汁 葡萄汁 橙汁和酸橙汁口味
We have it in cherry, grape, orange and lime.

565
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,600
真的吗? 等等 等等
-For real? -Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

566
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,560
你想让我回宝宝? 嘿,这是你最擅长的
-You want me to be a baby? -Hey, it's what you do best.

567
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,690
这样你就能潜入学校探查
So you can infiltrate the school and find out

568
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,400
阿姆斯特朗博士的阴谋
what Dr. Armstrong is really up to.

569
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,980
剩下的就交给"宝宝公司"
BabyCorp will take care of the rest.

570
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,490
这是完美的伪装
It's the perfect disguise.

571
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,450
而且只持续了48个小时
And it only lasts 48 teensy-weensy hours.

572
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,240
我也参与了这次任务
Oh, I am in on the mission.

573
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,410
对不起,老爸
Sorry, Pops.

574
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,290
-你不能参加 -哦
-It's not your mission. -Aw.

575
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,330
"可能会导致流口水,胡言乱语
" may cause drooling, babbling,

576
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,170
心神不定 情绪失控
"emotional outbursts, fits of laughter,

577
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,170
大小便失禁,胃食管反流?
loss of bowel control, chubby thighs"?

578
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,010
我健身房里的人会吃这个
I think some guys at my gym take this stuff.

579
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,930
我这能干的小手!
My texting hand!

580
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,260
即使那是你女儿的学校
Even though it is your daughter's school.

581
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,760
真不公平,对吧?
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

582
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,270
爸爸,别(请)喝
Daddy, no. Please stop.

583
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,680
哇!
Whoa!

584
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,310
什么?它真的有用
What? It actually works.

585
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,360
它是我的!
It's mine!

586
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,190
-做宝宝我更擅长 -哦!
-I'm better with this kind of thing! -Oh!

587
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,030
刚才你变成了啥 海鸥群吗?
And what kind of thing is that, Flock of Seagulls?

588
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,700
青春药水 拿到了
-Everything! -Gotcha!

589
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,540
你可能会很情绪化,心神不宁
You might feel very emotional, have some mood swings.

590
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,080
哦!
Oh!

591
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,630
嘿!
Hey!

592
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,920
哎哟 尴尬的年龄段
Ouch. There's the awkward stage.

593
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,550
来喝茶,康妮
Now, the tea's hot, Connie.

594
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,550
你总是想当英雄,不是吗?
You always have to be the hero, don't you?

595
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,470
这话什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

596
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,720
从来不看望她…
Never see him...

597
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,720
送匹小马就成为我女儿的偶像
All of a sudden, he shows up with a pony.

598
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,970
你只是嫉妒,锅盖头
You're just jealous, helmet head.

599
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,390
她是我的女儿!
She's my daughter!

600
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,060
她是我的侄女
She's my niece.

601
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,060
你要加奶油或糖吗?
Do you want cream or sugar?

602
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,610
我总是成功的那个
I was always the successful one.

603
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,240
妈妈说不许在家里乱跑

605
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,740
把药水给我,"鲻鱼头"
Hand over the bottle, mullet.

606
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,910
钱可不是万能的
You can't hug money, you know.

607
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,040
没钱可是万万不能的
But you can, Tim. You can.

608
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,960
争强好胜的男人
Men. Am I right?

609
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,850
这不是针对你
It's not personal.

610
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,680
公事公办而已
It's business, Leslie.

611
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,810
这是我的私事 林赛
Well, it's personal to me, Lindsey.

612

抱歉 康妮 我得长话短说

我们明天在谈心
Tomorrow, we'll talk about your problems.

615
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,530
够了! 别闹了!
Okay, time-out! This has gone far enough!

616
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,120
嘿 我们回家了
Hey. We're home.

617
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,660
我们买了另一棵树
And we got another tree.

618
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,910
一棵真正的树
A real one.

619
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,370
现在快上楼

拉 不 好吧
Pull. No, okay.

624

您已经到达目的地
You've arrived at your destination.

892
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,190
还有一分钟的时间
And with a minute to spare.

893
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,940
哦 嗯
Oh. Huh.

894
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,110

00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,320
我们做到了
We did it.

898
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,740
我想是的
I guess we did.

899
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,700
我刚是对宝贝骏马讲的
I was talking about me and Precious.

900
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,710
哦 是吧 宝贝
-Oh. -Isn't that right, baby?

901
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,920
好吧
Yeah. Right.

902
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,710
趴下!
Get down!

903
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,940
这地方看起来就不对劲
Whoa. This place even looks evil.

904
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,900
这只是一所学校
It's just a school.

905
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,650
你反应过度了
You're overreacting.

906
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,900
"宝宝公司"也是这样
And so is BabyCorp.

907
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,190
我告诉你
No, I'm telling you,

908
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,110
这所学校让塔比莎压力很大
this school is stressing Tabitha out.

909
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,860
塔比莎能搞定
Tabitha can handle it.

910
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,990
虎父无犬子
She's a real chip off the old block.

911
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,990
"虎"是谁? 我啊
-Wait, who's the block? -I'm the block.

912
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,830
我才是女儿的榜样
Well, you can't be the block. I'm the block.

913
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,330
先以身作则吧
Then start acting like a block.

914
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,170
难道我是做的还不够?
Wh-What does that mean? I'm the block.

915
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,040
我永远是楷模 呵 差远了
-I've always been the block. -Yeah. Not even close.

916
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,500
一直言传身教
All I do is block.

917
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,090
起早贪黑 勤勤恳恳
I wake up in the morning, I block.

918
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,960
上行下效
I go to sleep, blocking.

919
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,340
一代楷模 够了
-I'm the block. -Tim, enough.

920
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,930
躬先表率 不,别讲了!
-I'm the block. -No, you're not! Stop it!

921
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,220
嘘
Shh.

922
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,600
太好了
Sweet.

923
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,060
傻缺
Suckers.

924
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,020
由此进入校区 嘿
-Children only beyond this point. -Hey.

925
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,100
请勿在校区内哭泣
No crying is permitted in the separation zone.

926
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,690
看来我们得分头行动了
Okay, looks like we got to split up.

927
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,150
终于不用听你唠叨了
Good. I could use a break.

928
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,280
再见,妈妈 好的,亲爱的
-Bye, Mom. -All right, bye, honey.

929
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,860
塔比莎
There's Tabitha.

930
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,240
放学后见 好的
-I'll see you after school. -Okay.

931
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,030
团队合作

932
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,070
团队合作

933
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:31,110
团队合作

00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,730
粒子物理学
Particle physics.

1112
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,900
我没听错?
Yes! What?

1113
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,020
太好了!
Yes!

1114
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,530
谁知道哪个科学家
Who knows which scientist

1115
00:38:54,570 --> 00:39:02,830
普朗克尺度
德国物理学家马克斯•普朗克  量子力学创始人之一
1890年提出了一系列的自然单位来简化物理定律

1116
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,780
首先提出宇宙有极限的理论
first theorized that the universe has a limit

1117
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,490
超出这个范围物理定律就会失效?
beyond which the laws of physics break down?

1118
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,830
哇 似乎每个人都知道
Wow. Everybody seems to know.

1119
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:06,330
"光速"先生
Señor Lightspeed.

1120
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:09,870
-33

1121
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:09,870
最基本的普朗克单位分别为长度 质量 温度 时间和电荷
如最小的长度量子 1.6×10    cm

1122
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:09,870
嗯 "诡计"博士吗?
Um, Dr. Flam... baisley?

1123
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:28,440
当这些单位运用到物理定律的时候 物理学家惊奇地发现它们也代表着物理极限
( 这在数学上是完全可行的 但在物理上是不允许的 想象一下超光速的情况发生)
比普朗克还短的距离 更热的温度都是没有任何意义的 也就是说物理定律失效了

1124
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,750
回答错误
Oh, that's the wrong answer.

1125
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,590
他的大脑肯定不灵光
His brain sure doesn't move at light speed.

1126
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,380
哈哈 我知道,对吧?
-Uh, okay. -I know, right?

1127
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,260
还有吗? 我知道
-Anybody else? -Right here.

1151
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,680
直译为"跳出盒子思考"

1152

我爬 用胶水做东西
I crawled. I did things with glue

1397
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,130

你唯一做成功的事
The only thing you're ever gonna succeed at

1412
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,700

1593
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,160
我是在夸你 没恶意

1594
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:13,250
为什么表演赛让你如此紧张?
So, why is the pageant stressing you out so much?

1595

我要唱歌

你觉得他会让你难堪?
You're embarrassed of him?

00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,980
凭什么成年人是掌权者?
Why do parents get to be in charge, anyway?

他们把社会治理成啥样了?

成年人是我们成功路上的绊脚石
The only thing holding us back is them,

1676
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,660

01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:17,330
所有的接线员都在打盹
All operators are currently napping.

1886
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:19,870
等到我牙都长出来了
I've been on hold so long I got a tooth growing in.

1887
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,340
在我那个年代 都是写备忘录
Back in my day, we wrote memos.

1888
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:23,960
不错 老古董
That's cute and old-timey.

1889
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,340
年轻人真弱
I weep for the future.

1890
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,840
你想和我谈谈心吗?
Do you want to talk about your feelings now while I'm on hold?

1891
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,010
我可以给你20分钟
I can give you 20 minutes.

1892
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:32,300
不
No.

1893
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:33,930
让我们直蹦主题吧
Let's get to the nut, the nugget.

1894
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:35,430
你在害怕什么?
What are you afraid of?

1895
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:37,890
鲨鱼 被箭射中头部
Sharks, getting shot in the head with an arrow,

1896
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:39,310
和…美国国税局
and... the IRS.

1897
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:40,850
就这些 看吧
-That's it. -There you go.

1898
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,360
有那么难吗? 一步步来
Was that so hard? Baby steps.

1899
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,360
那么 孤独呢?
Now, what about being lonely?

1900
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,230
我不孤独 嗯
-I'm not lonely. -Mm-hmm.

1901
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,700
我习惯独处
I'm just... alone.

1902
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,200
这是有区别的
There's a difference.

1903
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,870
你该看看你的档案
I think it's time you read your file.

1904
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:53,490
给我
Just give me.

1905
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:54,910
哇 这就是?
Whoa. This is it?

1906
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:57,410
也太薄了
It's so thin.

1907
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:59,290
敬爱的宝贝老板
Dear Boss Baby,

1908
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:00,920
我向你保证
I promise you

1909
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,630
每天早上你醒来的时候 我都会在你身边
Every morning when you wake up, I will be there.

1910
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:06,380
每天晚饭的时候 我都会在
Every night at dinner, I will be there.

1911
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,800
每个生日派对 每个圣诞节早晨
Every birthday party, every Christmas morning,

1912
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,300
我都会陪伴你
I will be there.

1913
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:13,720
年复一年
Year after year after year.

1914
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:18,680
你和我是永远的兄弟
And you and I will always be brothers.

1915
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:20,600
永远
Always.

1916
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,400
为你俩感到抱歉
Makes me want to make a sad face.

1917
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:30,400
我们只是孩子
We were just kids.

1918
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:32,990
我们对现实世界一无所知
We didn't know anything about the real world.

1919
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:35,530
最终 你得长大
And eventually, you have to grow up.

1920
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,790
长大并不意味着
Just because you grow up, it doesn't mean

1921
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,330
你们必须分开
you have to grow apart.

1922
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:42,000
也许已经无法挽回了
I don't know. Maybe it's already too late.

1923
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,000
嘿
Hey.

1924
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,250
对不起 我迟到了
Sorry I'm late.

1925
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:46,840
爸爸!
Daddy!

1926
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,050
爸爸 爸爸
Daddy, Daddy.

1927
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:49,300
发生了什么?
What's going on?

1928
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:50,800
泰德叔叔真的很想你
Uncle Ted really misses you.

1929
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,180
是不是很好?
Isn't that nice?

1930
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:58,770
嘿 你在干嘛?
So, hey, uh, what you doing?

1931
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:00,230
哦 我在…
Oh, I was, uh...

1932
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:03,480
没什么 我只是在研究这个
I don't know, I was just working on this.

1933
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:10,530
我很抱歉 在操场说了那些话
Look, I'm sorry about what I said at recess.

1934
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:13,150
这句话改编自美国谚语
发生在拉斯维加斯的事 就留在拉斯维加斯吧
what happens in vegas stays in vegas

1935
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:13,150
时过境迁 既往不咎
What happens on the playground stays on the playground.

1936
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,070
我当时口不择言
I was just worried about Tabitha, you know?

1937
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,450
爱子心切 我懂
She's your daughter. I get it.

1938
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:18,160
我总是以己度人
This whole time, I was thinking about

1939
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,540
而不考虑女儿的诉求
what I wanted and not what she needed.

1940
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,710
我终于明白了这个育人的道理
I think I finally got this parenting thing figured out.

1941
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:23,870
给你满分 爸爸
Gold star for you, Daddy.

1942
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,540
再接再厉 老爸 还有件事
-Keep it up, Pops. -Yeah, well, about that.

1943
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:28,670
博士想对成年人 家长下手
Armstrong wants to get rid of parents somehow.

1944
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:31,010
什么? 他在计划一场宝宝革命
-Sorry, what? -He's planning a baby revolution.

1945
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:32,550
就不能消停会吗
Ugh, come on.

1946
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,800
偏偏在我刚擅长做父母时发生
Just when I got good at this whole parenting thing.

1947
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,300
我们得阻止他
We got to stop him.

1948
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:37,890
不是我们 就你一个?
-Not we. -You?

1949
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:39,260
我俩都不是
Neither one of us.

1950
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:40,930
"宝宝公司"接手 啊
-BabyCorp is taking it from here. -Ah.

1951
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:43,100
他们要派"宝宝"特种兵来吗?
So, what, they're gonna send in the Baby SEALS or something?

1952
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:43,100
美国"海豹"特种部队
UnitedStatesNavySea,AirandLand，SEAL
直属美国海军的一支特种部队

1953
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:44,640
大概吧 所以你…
-Looks like it. -So you'll, um...

1954
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:47,020
你会直奔办公室处理公务
you'll be headed back to your office.

1955
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,320
是的 保持联系 蒂姆
Uh, yeah. Well, keep in touch, Tim.

1956
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,150
喂 "宝宝公司"
Hello? BabyCorp?

1957
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:53,150
谢天谢地 终于接通啦…
Thank goodness, BabyCorp. Well, BabyCo...

1958
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:55,410
你在说什么
Wha-What? What are you saying,

1959
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:57,410
没有足够的证据吗?我…
there's not enough evidence, BabyCorp? I...

1960
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:59,240
所以你不打算采取行动?
So you're not gonna do anything?

1961
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,660
但是 我…
But, BabyCorp, I...

1962
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,370
既然如此那我们来处理
Ugh. Well, then we'll take care of it.

1963
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:04,160
宝宝公司
You know what, BabyCorp?

1964
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:05,580
我不干了!
I quit!

1965
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:07,710
真是群酒囊饭袋
What a bunch of diaper sniffers.

1966
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,670
看来得靠自己阻止博士了
Looks like we have to stop Armstrong ourselves.

1967
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:14,260
破坏阴谋 我喜欢
We're going rogue. I like it.

1968
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:15,930
任务又开始了? 是的
-So the mission's back on? -Yeah.

1969
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:18,720
前提是你俩能再容忍一下对方
If you two can put up with each other a little longer.

1970
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:22,020
我想我可以 蒂姆你呢?
I suppose I can live with that. Tim?

1971
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:23,020
我也觉得可行
I think that's doable.

1972
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,020
耶!
Yay!

1973
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:25,480
"被迫"组团合作
Forced together again.

1974
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,270
现在是8点45分
It's 8:45 p.m.

1975
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:30,360
我们的时间紧迫
Okay. Our clock is ticking.

1976
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,490
我们得在"变身"奶粉失效前阻止博士
We have to stop Armstrong before the formula wears off.

1977
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:36,910
齐心协力 我们将在表演赛上开始行动
Working as a team, we will strike at the pageant.

1978
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:38,200
开始吧 蒂娜
Go, Tina.

1979
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,530
这份绝密"文件"…
Now, this top secret document...

1980
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:42,040
亲爱的 是绝密"计划"
Sweetie, it's the program.

1981
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,370
这个绝密计划揭示了
This top secret program reveals

1982
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:47,370
博士计划向观众发表演讲
that Armstrong is scheduled to address the audience,

1983
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:50,460
他会在表演结束时攻击
which he will do right here at the very end.

1984
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,090
蒂姆 我们需要你在后台
We need someone backstage. Tim, that's you.

1985
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:55,760
我都不表演 怎么混进后台?
How am I gonna get backstage if I'm not in the pageant?

1986
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,630
我的人会解决的
My people will take care of that.

1987
01:11:58,510 --> 01:11:59,890
啊! 谢谢
-Ah! -Thank you.

1988
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:01,050
谢谢你!
Thank you.

1989
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,140
不! 太好了
-No! -Great.

1990
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:04,220
去…吧
And... go.

1991
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:05,680
"粘上"
Glue.

1992
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,900
别动 马上就好
There, there. All better.

1993
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:11,520
太棒了
Awesome.

1994
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:14,990
而我混在听众中 观察动向 传递情报
Now, I'll be your eyes and your ears in the audience.

1995
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,900
不能让妈妈发现我会讲话
I can't let Mommy see me talk,

1996
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:18,820
否则她会尖叫着拥抱我
or she's gonna start squealing and hugging me,

1997
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:20,570
但这些小玩意儿能让你
but these little doodads will let you

1998
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:22,410
听懂我的"儿语"
understand my baby talk.

1999
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:24,080
它被称为"嘎嘎"设备
It's called a GAGA device.

2000
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,450
真机灵 试一试
-Aw, that's cute. -Check it out.

2001
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:28,000
爸爸 你能听懂吗?
Can you hear me, Daddy?

2002
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,250
很精巧
Also cute.

2003
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:31,330
与此同时 有我做内应
Meanwhile, with my new purple status,

2004
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:33,380
我可以待在博士身边
I can stay close to Armstrong.

2005
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:35,420
嗯 那是眉毛
Um, that's-that's an eyebrow.

2006
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,420
哦 对不起 呃,不,那是,呃…
-Oh. Sorry. -Uh, no, that's, uh...

2007
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:39,180
当时机成熟
When the moment is right,

2008
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:40,800
我会植入一个装置
I'll implant a device.

2009
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,300
搞定 忘记什么?
-Got it. -Got what?

2010
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:43,510
我是说 你可以的
I mean, you've got this.

2011
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,560
去征服他们
Go get 'em, tiger.

2012
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,520
哦 谢谢你们大家
Oh, thank you, parents.

2013
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,940
谢谢!
Thank you. There's the...

2014
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:50,940
谢谢大家一如既往的支持
There's the old enthusiasm I like to see.

2015
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:53,320
这样我就能控制他的战衣了
This will allow me to control his suit.

2016
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,780
通过平板操纵"大胡子机器"
I can make Muttonchops do whatever I want.

2017
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,070
可以让他跳舞
I can make him dance.

2018
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:02,780
能使他腾跃
I can make him prance.

2019
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,620
嘿 不 不 展现秘密
-Hey, no, no, no, no. -Including exposing himself

2020
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:06,450
给观众知道
to the audience.

2021
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:09,250
每个家长都会拍下这一幕
Every parent will pull out their phone.

2022
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:11,630
别拍 别拍我!
Don't look at me. Don't look at me!

2023
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:14,250
照片会像尿布疹一样扩散
The photos will spread like a diaper rash.

2024
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:16,130
之后是欢庆披萨派对
Cut to our pizza party.

2025
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:19,300
有问题吗?
Questions?

2026
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:20,510
在塔比莎唱完之后开始?
After Tabitha sings her solo, right?

2027
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:22,010
对
After Tabitha sings.

2028
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:25,680
现在我们只用等待表演
Now we just sit back, relax and enjoy the show.

2029
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,980
家长们 欢迎来到学校的节日庆典
Welcome, parents, to our holiday pageant.

2030
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:34,480
记住 在礼堂里用闪光灯拍照
Remember, flash photography in the auditorium

2031
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,150
效果才是最好的
is absolutely okay.

2032
01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:39,950
录下孩子的精彩时刻 表达你的爱意
Take a picture. Show your kids that you love 'em.

2033
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:41,490
好啊!

01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:23,100
不错 邓普顿家
Not bad, Templetons.

2501
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:24,850
耶 邓普顿万岁
Woo-hoo! Yay, Templetons.

2502
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:26,350
是的 任务完成
Yeah, mission accomplished.

2503
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:29,520
阻止了博士只是附加任务
And as a bonus, we stopped Armstrong, too.

2504
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:31,060
嗯? 什么?
-Huh? -What?

2505
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:33,940
我真正的任务是让你们复合
My real mission was getting you two back together.

2506
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:36,780
对应00:12:04的台词
It's like, "F-minus. See me after class."

2507
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:36,780
"满分 课后嘉奖"
A-plus! See me after class.

2508
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:38,530
所以你从没辞职?
Wait, so you never actually quit?

2509
01:34:38,570 --> 01:34:39,780
不  嗯
-Nope. -Huh.

2510
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:40,950
干得漂亮
Well played.

2511
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:42,280
我喜欢公私分明
I don't like to mix the two,

2512
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,830
工作在后
but I will say it was never business.

2513
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,830
对应00:22:48的台词
It's not personal. It's business, Leslie.

2514
01:34:43,870 --> 01:34:45,370
家庭优先
It was always personal.

2515
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:46,740
你知道吗 孩子?
You know what, kid?

2516
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:49,040
你是我见过最好的老板
You're the best boss I ever had.

2517
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:50,670
谢谢你 长官
Thank you, chief.

2518
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:52,290
蒂姆! 你真的来了
Tim! You actually made it.

2519
01:34:52,330 --> 01:34:54,500
是的 你从不会让我失望
-Yeah. -I mean, I knew you'd make it.

2520
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:56,170
泰迪 泰迪 你在这里
-Teddy. -Teddy, you're here.

2521
01:34:56,210 --> 01:34:58,340
你衣服怎么了 额…
-And look what you're wearing. -Uh...

2522
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:00,300
你表演的太好了
Sweetheart, I cried.

2523
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:01,470
然后我就失忆了
Then I went blank.

2524
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:03,260
大家聚在一起拍个照
Oh, come on. Every-Everyone get together.

2525
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,140
纪念一下 准备要拍啦
This... We got to get this. Here we go.

2526
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:06,810
爸爸,不! 什么?
-Dad, no! -No! -What?

2527
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:10,730

2535
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:39,510
嘿 宝贝
Aw, hey, Precious.

2536
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:40,880

You're amazing.

2537
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,760
真希望泰迪能在这
Oh, I wish Teddy could have been here.

2538
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,840
我也是这样想
Yeah, I know. Me, too.

2539
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:48,560
嗯
Hmm.

2540

01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:08,240

-No. No, no, no, no. Don't, don't, don't. -Come here!

2552
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:36,060
我比你年轻
I'm younger than you.

2553
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:37,480
你更容易被砸中
You're a bigger target.

2554
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:39,670
我对你太好了!
I got you so good!

2555
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:41,440

-No, you didn't. -Aah! You missed me!

2556
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,070
你和我想的一样吗?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

2557
01:36:43,110 --> 01:36:44,490
伏击 不错
-Ambush. -Exactly.

2558
01:36:44,530 --> 01:36:45,950
噢! 偷袭!
-Ow! -Sneak attack!

2559
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:48,080
看到他们打闹真是太好了
Oh, isn't it great to see them fighting again?

2560
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:49,410
最后
Finally.

2561
01:36:52,410 --> 01:36:54,120
你不接电话吗?
Shouldn't you pick up?

2562
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:56,080
不 我们有家事要办
Nah, we got some family business.

2563
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,630
啊! 好!
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

2564
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:05,970
蒂娜 我们有个新任务给你
Tina, we have another assignment for you.

2565
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:07,220
我在听
I'm listening.

2566
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:09,260
奶奶端菜来啦!
Grandma's coming in hot!

2567
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:11,850
你要尝点吗 爷爷? 所有人 去抓小马!
-You want some of Grandpa? -Everyone, get Tagalong Teddy!

2568
01:37:11,890 --> 01:37:13,600
对 打到了!
-It's true. -Gotcha!

2569
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:15,310
你不能停止时间
You can't stop time.

2570
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:17,690
但可以抓住生命中的下一个机会
But every once in a while, you get a second chance.

2571
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:18,840
我会抓到你的!
I'm gonna get you!

2572
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:21,150
不要太过纠结于过去的失败
So, even though you're only a kid once...

2573
01:37:21,190 --> 01:37:22,980
除非你能返老还童
well, unless you get to be a kid twice,

2574
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:25,240
有些天方夜谭 扯远了
which is really weird, to be honest,

2575
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:28,240
重点是你总有一天要面对现实
but the point is you have to grow up sometime.

2576
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:33,240
那时别忘了陪伴和照顾你的亲人
And you should always be nice to your brother.

2577
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:35,330
你真贴心 爸爸
Ah, that was really sweet, Daddy.

2578
01:37:35,370 --> 01:37:37,210
这对我的报告很有帮助
That'll be great for my report.

2579
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:39,420
好吧 所以…就这样
Okay, so... so that's it, then.

2580
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:42,170
其实 还有一件小事
Well, actually, there's one more little thing.

2581
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:59,730
妈妈?爸爸?
Mama? Papa?

2582
01:38:00,910 --> 01:38:04,190
哦,我的儿子
Oh, my son.

2583
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,390
