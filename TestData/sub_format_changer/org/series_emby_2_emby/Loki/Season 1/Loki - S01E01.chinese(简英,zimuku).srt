不要 楼梯

16
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,250
洛基呢？
2012 THOR: Where's Loki?

17
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:18,208

你是谁？

22
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,625
你来我们这干什么？

别碰那个
Don't touch that.

26
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:36,000
看来是标准时序侵犯

代表时间变异管理局
On behalf of the Time Variance Authority,

不好意思 〝我们〞指的是谁？

最后一次警告 时间犯
Last chance, Variant.

36
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,656
这一天真是没完没了
It's been a very long day,

37
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:08,656
我受够了全副武装的白痴 对我指手画脚
and I think I've had my fill of idiots in armored suits telling me what to do,

38
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:12,750
所以不好意思 是我最后一次警告你们
so, if you don't mind, this is actually your last chance.

00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,666
你现在身处1/16的速度中
You are now moving at 1/16th speed,

41
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,958
但是痛感是实际的时间长度
but feeling all that pain in real time.

42
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,375
重置时间线
Reset the timeline.

43
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,791
-什么种族？ 斯库鲁时间犯
MAN 1: What species? MAN 2: Variant Skrull.

44
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,448
这是什么地方？
What is this place?

45
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,073
我爸爸是高盛董事会的
My dad is on the board of Goldman Sachs.

00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,365
他打个电话 你的工作就玩完了
One call and your whole job is privatized.

47
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,948
-好吧 你觉得怎么样？
MAN 3 : All right. MAN 4: How'd you like that?

48
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,458
你好 先生
MAN 1: Hello, sir.

49
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,323
-来吧 你犯了个严重的错误
-HUNTER B-15: Come on. You're making a terrible mistake.

50
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,416
你完全搞错了
MAN 4: You're making a big mistake. Whoa!

51
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,708
-你好 女士. . . 把这个记录为证物
-Hello, ma'am, uh. . . HUNTER B-15: Log this as evidence.

52
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,531
你能至少告诉我这是什么吗？
Oh. . . Can you at least tell me what it is?

53
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,708
这是宇宙魔方 小心点
It's the Tesseract. Be very careful with it.

54
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,458
听上去很蠢
MAN: It sounds dumb.

55
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,281
听好了
Know this.

56
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,448
你跟我作对 下场会很难看
You cross me, there are deadly consequences.

57
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,958
我等着看
We'll see.

58
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:20,167
Hey, hey!

59
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,416
你休想
Absolutely not.

60
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,083
这可是上等的阿斯加德皮革
This is fine Asgardian leather.

61
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,458
别动
Hold very still.

62
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,458
你等一下
Now, hang on just a minute.

还有这个
And this.

69
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,531
请确认你自知不是机器人
Please confirm to your knowledge that you are not a fully robotic being,

70
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,073
而是有机生物
were born an organic creature,

71
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,323
并拥有许多文明称之为灵魂的事物
and do in fact possess what many cultures would call a soul.

72
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,875
什么？我自知？
What? "To my knowledge"?

73
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,490
很多人不知道自己是机器人吗？
Do a lot of people not know if they're robots?

74
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,083
谢谢你的确认 请走过去
Thank you for confirming. Move through.

75
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,531
如果我是机器人但是自己不知道呢？
What if I was a robot and I didn't know it?

76
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,698
机器会将你完全熔化
The machine would melt you from the inside out.

77
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,291
继续移动 先生
Please move along, sir.

78
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,041
好吧 我不是机器人 我没事
Okay, I'm not a robot, so I'll be fine.

79
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,750
什么？
What?

80
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,531
-那是什么？ 你的现世光环
-LOKI: Oh, what's that? Your temporal aura.

81
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,500
-那是什么？ 请进去吧
-What's that? Please, through the door.

82
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,750
拿一张票
Take a ticket.

83
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,958
这是什么地方？速食店吗？不
What is this, a deli? No.

84
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,375
拿一张票
Take a ticket.

85
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,698
这一共就两个人
There's only two of us in here.

86
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,333
拿一张票
MINUTEMAN: Take a ticket.

87
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,541
你们搞错了 我不应该来这里
This is a mistake! I shouldn't be here!

88
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,531
你好 你可能觉得
Hey there! You're probably saying,

89
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,750
你们搞错了 我不应该来这里
"This is a mistake. I shouldn't even be here. "

90
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,781
欢迎来到时间变异管理局
Welcome to the Time Variance Authority.

91
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,323
我是时间小姐
I'm Miss Minutes,

92
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:36,041
我的职责就是 在你接受审判前 让你明白一些事情
and it's my job to catch you up before you stand trial for your crimes.

93
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,573
咱们别浪费时间啦
So let's not waste another minute.

94
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:43,041
坐好 拿起笔 听我讲
Settle in, sharpen your pencils, and check this out.

95
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:49,115
很久以前 有一场多元宇宙大战
Long ago, there was a vast multiversal war.

96
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,906
无数的时间线互相纷争 争夺霸权
Countless unique timelines battled each other for supremacy,

97
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:57,990
几乎完全毁灭了一切
nearly resulting in the total destruction of. . .

98
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:57,990
. . . well, everything.

99
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,281
就在那时 全知全能的 时间守护者出现了
But then, the all-knowing Time-Keepers emerged,

100
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:06,198
他们将多元宇宙合并为一条时间线 从而恢复了和平
bringing peace by reorganizing the multiverse into a single timeline,

101
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,125
这就是神圣时间线
the Sacred Timeline.

102
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:14,156
现在 时间守护者维护着世间万物
Now, the Time-Keepers protect and preserve the proper flow of time

103
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,865
确保着时间的正常流动
for everyone and everything.

104
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:21,990
但是有时 会有像你一样的人 偏离时间守护者设定的路径
But sometimes, people like you veer off the path the Time-Keepers created.

105
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,833
这些人就是时间犯
We call those Variants.

106
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,615
可能是你领头反抗 也可能就是上班迟到
Maybe you started an uprising, or were just late for work.

107
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:33,781
不管什么原因 偏离路径 就会造成关连事件
Whatever it was, stepping off your path created a nexus event,

108
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:37,281
如果不及时处理 就会引发混乱
which, left unchecked, could branch off into madness,

109
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,365
最终导致另一场多元宇宙大战
-leading to another multiversal war.

110
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,115
危险：多元宇宙

111
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,365
但不用担心
But, don't worry,

112
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,156
为了避免这种情况
to make sure that doesn't happen,

113
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:50,500
时间守护者创造了时间变异管理局 还有一群杰出的工作者
the Time-Keepers created the TVA and all its incredible workers.

114
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,990
时间变异管理局会介入并修复错误
The TVA has stepped in to fix your mistake

115
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,416
把时间重置到预定的路径中
and set time back on its predetermined path.

116
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,990
如果你的行径导致自己 不能回到原有的时间线上
Now that your actions have left you without a place on the timeline,

117
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,698
你就必须要为自己的罪行接受审判
you must stand trial for your offenses.

118
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:09,573
请坐好 我们会立刻为你安排法官
So sit tight, and we'll get you in front of a judge in no time.

119
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,698
确保你拿好了自己的票
Just make sure you have your ticket,

120
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:15,458
下一位有空的助理会接待你
and you'll be seen by the next available attendant.

121
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:20,281
时间变异管理局 永恒常相伴
-For all time. PEOPLE: Always.

时间变异管理局 叙事委员会

123
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,240
时间守护者？神圣时间线？
Time-Keepers? The Sacred Timeline?

124
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,781
谁会相信这种胡扯
Who actually believes this bunkum?

125
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,365
-你的票呢？ 先生 他没给我票 我要了
-MINUTEMAN: Ticket, sir? He didn't give me a ticket. I asked.

126
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,823
-你的票 先生 我找那个家伙要票了
-Ticket, sir! I tried to ask that guy for a ticket!

127
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:35,906
先生…
Sir. . .

128
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:39,916
你敢朝我大喊大叫 锅盖头？
What, you're raising your voice at me, bucket head?

129
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,073
感谢到访时间变异管理局
MISS MINUTES: Thanks for visiting the TVA.

131

133
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:27,198
追捕者和时间卫士 正在处理例行的关连事件
The hunter and his Minutemen responded to a routine nexus event.

134
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,698
他们到达现场时 遭到了伏击
It appears that when they arrived, somebody got the jump on 'em.

135
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,250
你觉得呢？
You think?

136
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,375
是他
HUNTER U-92: It's him.

137
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,666
没错 这刺伤和其它的一模一样
Yeah, stab wounds look consistent with the others.

138
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,958
尸体的位置表明 他们不知道是谁袭击了他们
Positioning of the bodies indicates they didn't know what the hell hit 'em.

139
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,333
重置设备也不见了
And reset charge is gone.

140
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,333
这是上周的第六次袭击
That's the sixth attack in the last week.

141
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,125
还只是已知的
That we know of.

142
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,333
-嘿 等等 后退 后退
-Hey! Wait, stand down! Stand down.

143
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,500
只是个孩子而已
It's just a kid.

144
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,615
对不起

145
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:12,291
我的朋友是个笨蛋

146
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,458
我也会说这条时间线上 所有的语言
HUNTER U-92: Hey, yo!

147

别担心 那个魔鬼害怕我们
Don't worry, that devil's afraid of us.

151
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,073
我们会解决他的
We're gonna take care of him.

152

并送你回到你该去地方
And we're gonna put you back where you belong.

153
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,990
那个蓝色. . .

154
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,583
那是什么？

155
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,333
带着礼物的恶魔
Devil bearing gifts.

156
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:29,583
继续搜索序列周期 寻找现世光环的迹象
Go ahead and run this for sequence period and any hints of temporal aura.

157
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,781
你知道这是徒劳的
You know we won't get anything.

158
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,166
没错 试试看吧
Yeah, just give it a shot.

159
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,041
这个分支已经接近红线了 咱们得撤了
HUNTER U-92: The branch is nearing red line. We need to go.

160
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,875
好吧
Okay.

161
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:46,375
去外面等着

162
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,583
没事的
It's okay.

163
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,875
设定重置器
HUNTER U-92: Set a reset charge.

164
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,166
长官 有些东西你得看看
Sir, there's something you'll wanna see.

165
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:07,198
已逮捕

166
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,166
下一个案件
JUDGE: Next case, please.

167
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:19,531
劳菲森 L1130号时间犯 又名洛基·劳菲森
Laufeyson. Variant L1130, AKA Loki Laufeyson,

168
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:24,041
你被指控侵犯序列7-20-89
is charged with sequence violation 7-20-89.

169
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,250
你有何申辩？
How do you plead?

170
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,500
女士 神是不会申辩的
Madam, a god doesn't plead.

171
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:36,948
这出荒诞剧很有意思 但是我得走了
This has been a very enjoyable pantomime, but I'd like to go home now.

172
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,250
你是有罪还是无罪 先生？
Are you guilty or not guilty, sir?

173
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,531
作为诡计之神而有罪？可以
Guilty of being the God of Mischief? Yes.

174
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,698
觉得这一切枯燥乏味而有罪？也可以
Guilty of finding all this incredibly tedious? Yes.

175
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:51,156
侵犯神圣时间线的罪名？
Guilty of a crime against the Sacred Timeline?

176
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,573
绝对不可能 你们抓错人了
Absolutely not, you have the wrong person.

177
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,698
真的吗？ 那我们应该抓谁？
Oh, really? And who should we have?

178
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,906
我觉得应该抓复仇者联盟
I suspect, the Avengers.

179
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,698
我能拿到宇宙魔方 都是因为他们的时间旅行
I came into possession of the Tesseract because they traveled through time,

180
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:06,281
他们绞尽脑汁就是为了 阻止我成为神圣帝王
no doubt in a last-ditch effort to stave off my ascent to God King.

181
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,406
这指控可不小啊
That's quite an accusation.

182
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,698
相信我 你都能闻到两个史塔克 身上的香水味
LOKI: Oh, believe me, you can smell the cologne of two Tony Starks.

183
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:15,448
你要找时间犯？ 他们才是时间犯
You speak of Time Criminals? It's they you should be after.

184
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:19,823
如果你给我一支军队和足够的资源
Perhaps you could provide me with a taskforce and resources,

185
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,490
我就能回去把他们消灭掉
and I could return and eliminate them for you.

186
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,406
我们现在说的不是复仇者联盟
We're not here to talk about the Avengers.

187
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,656
-不是吗？ 不是
-Oh, no? No.

188
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:30,125
他们的所作所为是应该发生的 但是你的逃脱不是
What they did was supposed to happen. You escaping was not.

189
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,625
好吧
Right. Uh. . .

190
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,541
不应该发生？谁规定的？
"Not supposed to happen"? According to whom?

191
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,406
时间守护者？
The Time-Keepers?

192
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,833
时间守护者啊 好吧
Oh, the Time-Keepers. Right.

193
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:49,583
好吧 也许我应该直接和 这些时间守护者进行神之间的对话
Well, perhaps I should speak to these Time-Keepers, gods to gods.

194
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,198
对不起 他们很忙
I'm sorry, but they're quite busy.

195
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,156
他们忙？他们在干什么？
Oh, they are? What are they doing?

196
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,115
规定时间的正确流动
Dictating the proper flow of time.

197
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,291
我明白了 好吧 那你们是干什么的？
I see. Right. And then what do you do?

198
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,281
按照他们的规定 来规定时间的正确流动
Dictate the proper flow of time according to their dictations.

199
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,916
你有何申辩？
How do you plead?

200
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,916
我的罪名. . .
Guilty. . .

201
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,833
就是这个
of this.

202
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,125
-他在干什么？ 等等 大家安静
-What's going on? LOKI: Hang on. Everyone quiet.

203
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,823
-他在试图使用他的力量 女士 别逼我
-He's trying to use his powers, ma'am. Don't rush me.

204
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,573
该死 为什么不起作用？
Damn it! Why won't it work?

205
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:34,625
魔法力量？在时间变异管理局这里无效 劳菲森先生
Magic powers? They're no good in the TVA, Mr. Laufeyson.

206
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,948
本庭认定你罪名成立 并判你重置
The court finds you guilty, and I sentence you to be reset.

207
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,531
下一个案件
Next case, please!

208
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:43,573
重置？那是什么意思？ 是坏结果吗？什么意思？
"Reset"? What does that mean? What, is it bad? What does it mean?

209
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:48,156
你们这些荒谬的官僚 你们无权决定我的结局
Hey! You ridiculous bureaucrats will not dictate how my story ends!

210
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,615
这不是你的结局 劳菲森先生 它和你根本没有关系
It's not your story, Mr. Laufeyson. It never was.

211
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,615
你们不知道我能干些什么
You have no idea what I'm capable of!

212
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,708
我想我知道
MAN: I. . . I think I might.

213
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,833
我知道他能干些什么
Have an idea of what he's capable of.

214
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,625
近前说话
Approach the bench.

215
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,666
你好
Hi.

216
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,531
如果我没猜错 那可不是什么好主意
If you're thinking what I think you are, it's a bad idea.

217
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,250
我只是在寻找一种可能性
Okay, I'm just chasing a hunch.

218
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,656
出了任何差错 都是你的责任
Anything goes sideways, it's on you.

219
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,406
没问题 我可是一直都仰视您的
Okay. I feel like I'm always looking up to you.

220
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,208
我很乐意 本该如此
I like it. It's appropriate.

221
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,833
你又是谁？
And who are you?

222
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,156
我要把这个地方烧成灰烬
I'm gonna burn this place to the ground.

223
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,541
我告诉你我的办公桌在哪 你可以从那烧起
I'll show you where my desk is, you can start there.

224
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,791
看看吧
Have a look.

225
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,791
回家真好
Home sweet home.

226
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,781
我还以为这里没有魔法
I thought there was no magic here.

227
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,333
确实没有
There isn't.

228
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,541
这都不是真的
That's not real.

229
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,323
不幸的是 这是真的 那些文书工作也是
It is, and, unfortunately, so is all the paperwork.

230
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,791
倒是不错的放火材料 来吧
Good tinder for your fire, though. Come on.

231
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,781
这地方就是个噩梦
This place is a nightmare.

232
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,115
那是另一个部门
That's another department.

233
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,791
那个部门我可以帮你一起烧
Now that department I'll help you burn down.

234
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,500
我是莫比乌斯探员
I'm Agent Mobius, by the way.

235
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,281
你是要把我带到什么地方杀掉吗？
Are you taking me somewhere to kill me?

236
00:19:56,291 --> 00:20:00,125
不是 刚才的地方才会 我要带你去个地方谈谈
No. That's where you just were. I'm taking you some place to talk.

237
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,615
我不想说话
I don't like to talk.

238
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,583
但是你喜欢说谎 你刚刚就说了一个
But you do like to lie, which you just did.

239
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,698
我们都知道你喜欢说话
Because we both know you love to talk.

240
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,666
没完没了
Talkie-talkie.

241
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,833
你在这多长时间了
How long have you been here?

242
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:17,166
我不知道 很难说 时间变异管理局的时间流动不太一样
I don't know. It's hard to say, time passes differently here in the TVA.

243
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,250
-那是什么意思？ 你会明白的
-What does that mean? You'll catch up.

244
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:25,323
所以你就是时间变异管理局 勤劳勇敢的工作人员？
LOKI: So, you're part of the TVA's courageous and dedicated workforce?

245
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,448
是的
Yes.

246
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,823
-你是时间守护者创造的？ 是的
-You were created by the Time-Keepers. Yep.

247
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,333
-为了保护神圣时间线 没错
-To protect the Sacred Timeline. Correct.

248
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,833
很搞笑吗？
Is that funny?

249
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,781
你们这个小破地方 主宰着世间无数人的命运
The idea that your little club decides the fate of trillions of people

250
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:43,281
听命于三个太空蜥蜴
across all of existence at the behest of three space lizards,

251
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,916
确实挺搞笑的
yes, it's funny.

252
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,365
这太荒谬了
It's absurd.

253
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,375
我以为你不想说话呢
I thought you didn't like to talk.

254
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,583
你先请
After you.

255
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,865
话说回来 这地方真的像是 要把我杀掉的地方
For the record, this really does feel like a killing-me kind of a room.

256
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,250
你不怎么信任别人 是不是
Not big on trust, are you?

257
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,281
只有小孩子和狗才会信任别人
Trust is for children and dogs.

258
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,156
只有一个人你能信任
There's only one person you can trust.

259
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,198
你自己？我喜欢这个想法
MOBIUS: Yourself? I like it.

260
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,291
可以印在T恤上
Slap it on a T-shirt.

261
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,240
如果时间变异管理局一直在监视着
If the TVA truly oversees all of time,

262
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,656
我怎么之前从来没听说过？
how have I never heard of you until now?

263
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,323
因为没那个必要
'Cause you've never needed to.

264
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,573
你一直在设定好的路径里
You've always lived within your set path.

265
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,031
我想在哪条路径 就在哪条路径
I live within whatever path I choose.

266
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,375
当然可以 好吧 请坐
MOBIUS: Sure you do. Okay, come have a seat.

267
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,333
我告诉过你 在时间变异管理局 时间的流动不太一样
I told you, time moves differently in the TVA.

268
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,208
来吧 请坐
Come on, sit down.

269
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,666
咱们准备开始
Let's get into this.

270
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,083
来吧 请坐
Go on, have a seat.

271
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,583
你的眼神能杀人
If looks could kill.

272
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,500
你想从我这得到什么？
What do you want from me?

273
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,500
咱们先来一点小小的合作
Well, let's start with a little cooperation.

274
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,948
我可不擅长
Not my forte.

275
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,073
真的吗？
Really?

276
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,240
即便是在你一边示好 一边准备背叛的时候？
Even when you're wooing someone powerful you intend to betray?

277
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,750
来吧
Come on.

278
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,448
你对我一无所知
You don't know anything about me.

279
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,208
也许我愿意学呢
Maybe I'd like to learn.

280
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,250
我的专长是追踪那些 危险的时间犯
I specialize in the pursuit of dangerous Variants.

281
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,958
比如我自己？
Like myself?

282
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,073
不 是特别危险的时间犯
Mmm. . . No, particularly dangerous Variants.

283
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:35,166
你就是只小猫咪
You're just a little pussycat.

284
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,323
我有些问题要问你
I got a set of questions for you.

285
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,781
如果你能诚实回答
You answer them honestly,

286
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,166
也许我可以给你想要的东西
and then maybe I can give you something you want.

287
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,166
你想从这里出去 是不是？
You wanna get out of here, right?

288
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:45,865
没错 那我们开始吧
Yeah, so we'll start there.

289
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,458
你要是能回去 你要去干什么？
Should you return, what are you gonna do?

290
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:53,458
-完成我已经开始的事情 那是什么？
-Finish what I started. Which is?

291
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,198
确立我的王位
Claim my throne.

292
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,531
你想成为国王？
You wanna be king?

293
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,615
我不是想成为国王 我生而为王
I don't want to be, I was born to be.

294
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,708
我知道 但是具体是什么国王呢？
I know, but king of what exactly?

295
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,115
你不会明白的
You wouldn't understand.

296
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,625
说来听听
Try me.

297
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,490
米德加德
Midgard.

298
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,750
也就是地球
AKA Earth.

299
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,240
好吧 现在你是米德加德的国王了 然后呢？
All right. Now you're the king of Midgard, then what?

300
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,916
幸福地生活下去了？
Happily ever after?

301
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,166
然后是阿斯加德 以及全部九界
Asgard, the Nine Realms.

302
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,281
-全宇宙？ 全宇宙？
-Space? Space?

303
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:28,156
宇宙那么大 那可是不小的成就啊
Space is big. That'd be a nice feather in your cap.

304
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:30,125
洛基 宇宙之王
"Loki, the King of Space. "

305
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,948
你嘲讽我一个试试
Mock me if you dare.

306
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,750
不 我没有
No, I'm not.

307
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:38,198
其实我可是个粉丝
Honestly, I'm actually a fan. Yeah.

308
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:44,666
我不明白 为什么一个人 有这么大能力 却只想统治
And I guess I'm wondering why does someone with so much range just wanna rule?

309
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,490
我会让他们更加轻松
I would've made it easy for them.

310
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,990
人们喜欢轻松
People like easy.

311
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,625
史上第一个也是最大的谎言
The first and most oppressive lie ever uttered

312
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,073
就是自由的意志
was the song of freedom.

313
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,365
这是从何说起？
How's that one go?

314
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:03,416
对于几乎所有的生命而言
For nearly every living thing,

315
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:09,000
选择滋生的就是羞耻 不确定性和悔恨
choice breeds shame and uncertainty and regret.

316
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,323
每条道路都凶险无比
There's a fork in every road,

317
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:15,448
人们总是选择错误的道路
yet the wrong path always taken.

318
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,198
说得好
Good. Yeah.

319
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,906
你说 几乎所有的生命
You said "nearly every living thing, "

320
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,250
也就是说 你不在其中
so I'm guessing you don't fall into that category?

321
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,458
时间守护者建造了一个大马戏团
The Time-Keepers have built quite the circus,

322
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:32,583
你们这些小丑 在完美地诠释着自己的角色
and I see the clowns are playing their parts to perfection.

323
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,115
你这个满嘴隐喻的家伙 我挺喜欢的
Big metaphor guy. I love it.

324
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,990
听上去很聪明的样子
Makes you sound super smart.

325
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,625
我就是聪明
I am smart.

326
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:40,948
我知道
I know.

327
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:42,583
好吧
Okay.

328
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,791
好吧
Okay.

329
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,000
这是什么？
What is this?

330
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:10,333
你生命中的重要时刻样本 我给你看看
A sampling of your greatest hits, if I may.

331
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,916
如果还可以的话
LOKI: If it's all the same to you. . .

332
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:24,250
我想喝那杯酒
I'll have that drink now.

333
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,541
不用了
No.

334
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,625
我记得 我就在那 还有其它的吗？
And I remember. I was there. Anything else?

335
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:35,875
很有趣 你这个天生统治的人 居然经常一败涂地
It's funny, for someone born to rule, you sure do lose a lot.

336
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:38,281
都快成你命中注定的了
You might even say it's in your nature.

337
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:42,198
你要知道 上一个和我这么说话的人 最后没什么好下场
You know, things didn't turn out so well for the last person who said that to me.

338
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,166
没错 菲尔·寇森
Oh, yeah, Phil Coulson.

339
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:47,750
不
THOR: No!

340
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:52,240
复仇者联盟不是一起打败了你 为他复仇了吗？
Didn't the Avengers come together to literally avenge him by defeating you?

341
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,490
对于一个死人而言小小的慰藉罢了
Little solace to a dead man.

342
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,250
你喜欢伤害别人吗？
Do you enjoy hurting people?

343
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
让他们觉得自己渺小
Making them feel small?

344
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,406
让他们心存恐惧
Making them feel afraid?

345
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:04,073
-你的把戏吓不到我 让他们感觉微不足道
-Your games don't frighten me. Making them feel little?

346
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,323
我知道我是谁
I know what I am.

347
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:07,583
-一个凶手？ 一个解放者
-A murderer? A liberator.

348
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,750
解放的是眼球吧
Of eyeballs, maybe.

349
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:15,240
看看那个笑容 你真是乐在其中
MOBIUS: Look at that smile. You are enjoying that.

350
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,823
你喜欢伤害他们吗？
Did you enjoy hurting them?

351
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:19,115
我没必要跟你玩下去 我是神
I don't have to play this game. I'm a god.

352
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,406
什么神来着？诡计是吗？
Of what, again? Mischief, right?

353
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:25,333
我没看出这里有什么诡计
Yeah. I don't see anything very mischievous about this.

354
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,208
你确实看不出来
No, I don't suppose you do.

355
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:33,531
咱们来聊聊你的逃跑吧
Let's talk about your escapes.

356
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:37,906
你真的很擅长做些可怕的事 然后自己脱身
You're really good at doing awful things, and then just getting away.

357
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:41,041
那又怎么样？我可是诡计多端的骗子
What can I say? I'm a mischievous scamp.

358
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,541
这是我最喜欢的片段之一
This is one of my favorites.

359
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,615
这里是驾驶舱 我是机长威廉·A·斯科特
From the flight deck, Captain William A. Scott,

360
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:51,281
西北东方航空305号班机 飞往西雅图
Northwest Orient Airlines 305, on schedule to land in Seattle.

361
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:53,115
今天的飞行时间大约是. . .
Flight time today, approximately. . .

362
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,791
波本威士忌配苏打水？
Bourbon and soda?

363
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,865
谢谢
Thank you.

364
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:59,875
没问题 还有什么需要我做的吗 先生？
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Absolutely. Is there anything else I can do for you, sir?

365
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:03,291
我想咱们都知道 是不是？
I suppose we'll find out, won't we?

366
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:11,615
-小姐 怎么 库珀先生？
-Uh, Miss? Yes, Mr. Cooper?

367
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:14,375
你最好看看那张纸条
You might want to take a look at that note.

368
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,041
我带了炸弹
I have a bomb.

369
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:36,323
我看不出来这有什么关系. . .
I fail to see how this has any relevance or bearing on. . .

370
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:38,416
不 这是最精彩的部分
No. This is the good part.

371
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,625
改天再见
See you again someday.

372
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,708
哥哥 海姆达尔 你们等着
Brother, Heimdall, you better be ready.

373
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:17,781
我不敢相信你居然是D·B·库珀 真的吗
I can't believe you were D. B. Cooper. Come on!

374
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:20,406
我那时还年轻 而且和索尔打输了赌
I was young, and I lost a bet to Thor.

375
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:23,740
我在胡搞这些的时候 时间管理局在哪里？
Where was the TVA when I was meddling with these affairs of men?

376
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,990
我们就在那里 在神圣时间线上
We were right there with you, just surfing that Sacred Timeline.

377
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,156
所以时间守护者允许那些事发生是吗？
So that had the Time-Keepers' seal of approval, did it?

378
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:33,448
我觉得和允许不允许没什么关系
Well, I wouldn't think of it in terms of approval and disapproval.

379
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,083
那是一种. . .
That's sort of a. . .

380
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:38,990
咱们还是回来继续聊逃跑吧 还有些心理问题
Let's get back to escapes. . . . . . and a little psychobabble.

381
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,865
你觉得自己在逃避些什么？
What is it that you think that you're really running from?

382
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:43,416
够了
Enough.

383
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,541
回来坐好
Back in your cage.

384
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,281
看 我也不是吃素的
See, I can play the heavy keys, too.

385
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:52,833
我只是要站起来发表一个观点
I was just standing up to make a point.

386
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:53,990
对不起 你继续
I'm sorry, go ahead.

387
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,365
现在没意义了
It won't be as meaningful now.

388
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:56,615
好吧 那就继续坐着
Okay, well, stay seated.

389
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:57,948
我想干什么就干什么
I'll do what I want to do!

390
00:28:57,958 --> 00:28:59,458
当然
Sure.

391
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,031
你到底想要什么？
What exactly is it that you want?

392
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:09,740
我想让你诚实面对为什么要做那些事
I want you to be honest about why you do what you do.

393
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,865
骗子
Liar.

394
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:11,948
我很认真的
I'm serious.

395
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:18,166
我想深入挖掘恐怖的诡计之神 内心的真实想法
All I seek is a deeper understanding of the fearsome God of Mischief.

396
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,073
是什么在驱使着洛基?
What makes Loki tick?

397
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:23,698
-我知道这是什么地方了 什么地方？
-I know what this place is. What is it?

398
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,541
都是幻像
It's an illusion.

399
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:33,656
这是一个残酷而又精心设计的骗局 由弱者操纵的制造恐惧的工具
It's a cruel, elaborate trick conjured by the weak to inspire fear.

400
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:36,948
是为了掌控他人的一场疯狂试验
A desperate attempt at control.

401
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:39,281
你们在这里走来走去
Now, you all parade about

402
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:43,208
仿佛自己是宇宙中至高无上的仲裁
as if you're the divine arbiters of power in the universe.

403
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,625
-我们就是 你们不是
-We are. You're not.

404
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:47,656
我的选择是我自己的
My choices are my own.

405
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:50,031
你的选择就是你的 没问题 咱们继续吧
Your choice is your own. Good, let's go with that.

406
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:51,781
我觉得这个你看了肯定兴奋
I think this one's gonna fire you up.

407
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:55,823
自由的诱惑剥夺了你们人生中的快乐
The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy

408
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:58,323
你们疯狂地追求权势
in a mad scramble for power. . .

409
00:29:58,333 --> 00:29:59,833
没错
Precisely.

410
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:01,948
我. . .
I was. . .

411
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:05,448
我差一点就得到了我本该得到的一切
I am on the verge of acquiring everything I am owed,

412
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:07,740
我能得到是因为我的所作所为
and when I do, it'll be because I did it.

413
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,573
而不是因为它本该如此
Not because it was supposed to happen.

414
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:13,781
也不是因为你或时间变异管理局
Or because you or the Time Variance Authority,

415
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:17,375
或者什么你们自称的玩意的允许
or whatever it is you call yourselves, allowed me to.

416
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,541
说实话 你挺可悲的
Honestly, you're pathetic.

417
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,583
你是个无关紧要的存在
You're an irrelevance.

418
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,541
多余的存在
A detour.

419
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:25,708
我前进路上的脚注
A footnote to my ascent.

420
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,948
你说完了吗？
You finished?

421
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:31,583
你得开始认真对待这一切
You're gonna start taking things seriously.

422
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,323
如果你没有拿起宇宙魔方
If you hadn't picked up the Tesseract,

423
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:36,416
你就会被关押在阿斯加德的牢房里
you would have been taken to a cell on Asgard.

424
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,833
洛基
Loki.

425
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:48,416
你好 母亲
LOKI: Hello, Mother.

426
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:50,490
你为我感到骄傲吗？
Have I made you proud?

427
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,240
不要把事情变得更糟
Please don't make this worse.

428
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,323
这是什么？
What is this?

429
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,990
这是胡扯 这是骗局 这从来没发生过
This is nonsense, more tricks. This never even happened.

430
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,115
对于你没发生过
MOBIUS: Not to you.

431
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,791
还没有发生
Not yet.

432
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:02,490
时间变异管理局知道的不仅是你的过去
Look, the TVA doesn't just know your whole past,

433
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,990
我们知道你的一生会注定发生什么
we know your whole life, how it's all meant to be.

434
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,041
你可以当作是一种安慰
Think of it as comforting.

435
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,365
这太荒谬了
This is absurd.

436
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,666
我也不是你的母亲吗？
And am I not your mother?

437
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:16,000
你不是
LOKI: You're not.

438
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,792
FRIGGA: Hmm.

439
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:25,073
你好像已经把所有人都看透了 除了你自己以外
Always so perceptive about everyone but yourself.

440
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:29,740
然后黑暗精灵袭击了宫殿 你以为你把他们引到了索尔那边
MOBIUS: And then the Dark Elves attack the palace,

441
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,740
and you think you send them to Thor.

442
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,666
我觉得你应该走左侧的楼梯
You might wanna take the stairs to the left.

443
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,333
但其实 你把他们引去了. . .
But instead, you send them. . .

444
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:37,166
我不会告诉你
I'll never tell.

445
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:54,750
你们把她带到哪去了？她在哪？
Where do you have her? Where is she?

446
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:56,365
你把他们直接引去了她那里
You lead them right to her.

447
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:59,198
我不相信你 你在说谎 这不是真的
I don't believe you. You're lying. It's not true.

448
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,115
这是真的
It is true.

449
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,906
这是时间正确的流动
That's the proper flow of time,

450
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:07,365
它会一次又一次地发生 因为本该如此
and it happens again and again and again because it's supposed to,

451
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:08,573
因为必须如此
because it has to.

452
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:11,281
-时间变异管理局确保这一点 她在哪？
-The TVA makes sure of it. Where is she?

453
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:14,906
现在你为什么不告诉我 你喜欢伤害人吗？
Now why don't you tell me, do you enjoy hurting people?

454
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:17,031
-我不相信你 你喜欢杀戮吗？
-I don't believe you. Do you enjoy killing?

455
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,375
-我要杀了你 就像你对你母亲一样？
-I'll kill you. Like you did your mother?

456
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:29,448
抱歉 时间逆转器只倒转了你 没倒转椅子
Sorry, the Time Twister just loops you, not the furniture.

457
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,490
你并非生而为王 洛基
You weren't born to be king, Loki.

458
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,906
你的出生造成了痛苦 折磨和死亡
You were born to cause pain and suffering and death.

459
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:38,656
现在如此 过去如此 未来亦如此
That's how it is, that's how it was, that's how it will be.

460
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:43,666
这样其他人才能成就最辉煌的自我
All so that others can achieve their best versions of themselves.

461
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:02,583
这是什么地方？
What is this place?

462
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,958
来吧
Come on.

463
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,625
你在干什么？
HUNTER B-15: What are you doing?

464
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:19,323
这是我的工作 你的工作就是打断别人吗？
My job. Is it yours to interrupt?

465
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,625
出状况了
We have a situation.

466
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,333
总是会出状况
There's always a situation.

467
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:28,125
哪也别去
Don't go anywhere.

468
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,666
一切渐入佳境 我正在兴头上
It was just getting good. Spirited.

469
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,906
-和那个时间犯交谈是个错误 那是你的立场
-Talking to that Variant is a mistake. That's your position.

470
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:42,240
他应该被重置
He should be reset!

471
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:45,156
你觉得每个人都应该被重置 我大有收获
You think everyone should be reset. I'm getting good stuff!

472
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,666
我们又失去了一支小队
We lost another unit.

473
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:54,208
好吧 洛基 我觉得咱们明天结束以后再. . .
Okay, Loki, I think we can finish up tomorrow and just pick it. . .

474
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:08,666
诡计多端的骗子
Mischievous scamp.

475
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,406
真希望我会对此感到意外
Wish I could say I was surprised.

476
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:29,198
-真希望你没有打断我们 我？这是我的错？
-Yeah, I wish you hadn't interrupted us. Me? It's my fault?

477
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,948
他不可能跑太远
Look, he can't have gotten very far.

478
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:33,448
分头行动 发现他后立刻裁减
HUNTER B-15: Split up. Prune on sight.

479
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:36,833
不 不要裁减 不要重置 他能帮助我们
No, no pruning, no resetting. He can still help us!

480
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,573
你好
Hey.

481
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:48,365
你好 我认识你
Hey. I know you.

482
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:50,666
你是那个带着蓝盒子的罪犯
-You're that criminal with the blue box.

483
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,875
你叫什么名字
-Ow. What's your name?

484
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,750
凯西
Casey.

485
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:58,656
给我宇宙魔方 否则我就像 刴鱼一样把你开肠破肚 凯西
Give me the Tesseract, or I'll gut you like a fish, Casey.

486
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:00,198
鱼是什么？
-What's a fish?

487
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,281
鱼是什么？
What's a fish?

488
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:02,906
你怎么连鱼是什么都不知道？
How do you not know what a fish is?

489
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,740
我这一辈子都在办公桌后面
I've lived my entire life behind a desk.

490
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,406
这有什么意义？
Well, what difference does it make?

491
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:09,281
在我顺从之前 我想确切地知道威胁是什么
I wanna know exactly what I'm being threatened with before I comply.

492
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:12,198
死亡 凯西 暴力的痛苦的死亡
Death, Casey. Violent, painful death.

493
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:15,708
好吧 好吧 我听你的
Okay, okay. I comply, I comply.

494
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:18,875
我听你的 天啊
I comply. Jeez!

495
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:23,407
Um. . . Oh.

496
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:24,916
是这个吗？
-CASEY: This it?

497
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:31,416
什么？
LOKI: What?

498
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:34,041
无限原石？
Infinity Stones?

499
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:37,583
怎么会. . .
How. . .

500
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:40,333
你们怎么会有这些？
How do you have these?

501
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,365
实际上我们有许多
Oh, We actually get a lot of those.

502
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:45,250
有些人拿来做镇纸
Yeah. Some of the guys use them as paperweights.

503
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,208
有些人吧
Some of 'em.

504
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:30,833
这里是全宇宙最强大的力量吗？
Is this the greatest power in the universe?

505
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,531
你差点打到我
CASEY: Oh, you almost hit me!

506
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:46,333
太过分了
That's so messed up.

507
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:49,166
分头行动 搜索下层大厅
HUNTER B-15: Split up. Check the lower concourse.

508
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,583
我不会原谅你的
CASEY: I do not forgive you.

509
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,958
我爱你们 我的孩子们
I love you, my sons.

510
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:54,125
记住这个地方
Remember this place.

511
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:57,000
家园
Home.

512
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,041
洛基 你对我很重要
Loki, I thought the world of you.

513
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:21,125
我觉得咱们俩能永远并肩作战
I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever.

514
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:28,990
我忽然觉得你并没那么坏 弟弟
Maybe you're not so bad after all, brother.

515
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,500
那可没准
Maybe not.

516
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,416
谢谢
THOR: Thank you.

517
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:35,250
你要是在我身边 我真想拥抱你
If you were here, I might even give you a hug.

518
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,708
我在这儿
LOKI: I'm here.

519
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,875
不死的？
THANOS: Undying?

520
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:57,333
你还真是大言不惭呢
You should choose your words more carefully.

521
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,833
你…
LOKI: You. . .

522
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,416
永远不会成为…
will never be. . .

523
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:18,500
真正的神
a god.

524
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,083
档案结束

525
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:11,041
什么这么好笑
HUNTER B-15: What's so funny?

526
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,541
光荣的使命
Glorious purpose.

527
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:04,041
住…
Stop. . .

528
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,625
手
It.

529
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,708
住手
Stop it!

530
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,573
St. . . Stop it. . .

531
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:12,990
It. . . Stop it. . .

532
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,542
Stop. . . I. . . St. . . Sto. . . St. . .

533
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:28,490
这家伙一直说要把我变成鱼
And this guy kept saying he was gonna turn me into a fish,

534
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,615
不管那是什么
whatever that is,

535
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,906
然后他们就出现了 裁减了我的推车
and then they show up and just prune my cart,

536
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:34,083
我什么都干不了了
so there was nothing I could have done.

537
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,281
就是你
Hey, there you are.

538
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:41,083
你知道吗 那个时间犯逃跑了
You know, that Variant you had got away.

539
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:00,458
洛基？
MOBIUS: Loki?

540
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:04,583
你无路可逃了
Nowhere left to run.

541
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:09,750
我回不去了 是不是？
I can't go back, can I?

542
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,666
回到我的时间线
Back to my timeline.

543
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:24,791
我不喜欢伤害人
I don't enjoy hurting people.

544
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:29,958
我. . .
I. . .

545
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,791
我不喜欢
I don't enjoy it.

546
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,323
我那么做是因为我必须那么做
I do it because I have to,

547
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:39,000
因为我别无选择
because I've had to.

548
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:41,073
好吧 和我说说
Okay, explain that to me.

549
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:43,958
因为这是幻象的一部分
Because it's part of the illusion.

550
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:51,916
这是一个残酷而又精心设计的骗局 一个弱者操纵的制造恐惧的工具
It's the cruel, elaborate trick conjured by the weak to inspire fear.

551
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,250
是为了掌控他人的疯狂行径
A desperate play for control.

552
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:56,875
你还挺了解自己的
You do know yourself.

553
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:00,208
我是一个坏人
A villain.

554
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:02,916
我倒不这么觉得
That's not how I see it.

555
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:11,156
你试着用了？
You try to use that?

556
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:12,958
用了好几次
Oh, several times.

557
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:17,875
即使是无限原石在这里也没用
Even an Infinity Stone is useless here.

558
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:23,083
时间变异管理局真是令人敬畏
The TVA is formidable.

559
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:25,583
这就是我的感受
MOBIUS: That's been my experience.

560
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:28,958
听着 我不能给你救赎
Listen, I can't offer you salvation,

561
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:31,833
但是也许我可以给你更好的
but maybe I can offer you something better.

562
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:37,458
一个在逃的时间犯在杀害我们的时间卫士
A fugitive Variant's been killing our Minutemen.

563
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:41,781
你需要诡计之神来帮你制止他？
And you need the God of Mischief to help you stop him?

564
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:43,666
没错
That's right.

565
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,990
为什么是我？
Why me?

566
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,416
因为我们在追捕的时间犯就是. . .
The Variant we're hunting is. . .

567
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,416
你
you.

568
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,833
你说什么？
I beg your pardon?

569
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:58,740
俄克拉荷马州 萨莱纳

570
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:02,583
1858年

571
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:26,000
时间标记是第三个千年初期 绝对不符合时间线
MINUTEMAN: Time signature is early third millennium.

572
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:26,000
Definitely anachronistic.

573
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:33,750
是石油
Oil.

574
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:36,115
我认为这个混蛋找到了一台时间机器
I think some jackass found himself a time machine,

575
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:37,615
为了发财回到这里
came back here to get rich.

576
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:40,115
我们要展开追捕吗 长官？
Should we fan out and look for him, sir?

577
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:43,198
不了 还不够咱们写文书的呢
Nah. It's not worth the paperwork.

578
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:46,375
裁减掉吧 咱们走 设置重置器
Just prune it. Let's bail. Set a charge.

579
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,541
等等 有人在那
MINUTEMAN: Wait. Someone's out there.

580
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,083
去看看
Check it out.

581
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:06,291
后退
HUNTER U-92: Get down!

582
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:49,000
根据漫威漫画改编

583
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:39,948
漫威影业 出品

584
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:47,458
《洛基》

585
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:18,115
感谢到访时间变异管理局
MISS MINUTES: Thanks for visiting the TVA.

586
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:20,448
请为我们的服务留下宝贵评价
Don't hesitate to let us know how we're doing.
